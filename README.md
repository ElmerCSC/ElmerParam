# ElmerParam
ElmerParam is a simple tool for parametrized computation for software
that uses ASCII-format input and output files. It was primarily designed to
be used with Elmer, but can easily be used with other software packages as
well.  The parametrized approach is particularly useful for optimization
purposes.

ElmerParam exists both as a standalone program and as a library API with
bindings for C, Fortran, R and Matlab.
